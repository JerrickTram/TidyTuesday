# TidyTuesday

This is the Tidy Tuesday repo I'll be using for the #TidyTuesday weekly challenge held by
the R4DS Community on Twitter.

Recently finding out about this community from Reddit, I look forward to having some
fun with data visualizations and other libraries I've yet to use. Future folders will
include R Notebooks and the dataset itself (if it's not that big).
